Footing - Keeping projects in sync with templates
=================================================

Footing provides templated project creation and management.

The main functionality of footing includes:

1. Creating new projects from `cookiecutter`_ templates.
2. Listing all available templates under a git forge such as Github or Gitlab, along with listing all projects created from
   those templates.
3. Keeping projects up to date with the template as it changes.

A quick start is provided below. Be sure to go through the :ref:`installation` section before starting. It's
also useful to read about `cookiecutter`_ templates since they form the foundation of this tool.
