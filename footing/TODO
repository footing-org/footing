Daily:

- Reference the "git" from the installation directory, otherwise you can't use footing without being in a footing shell


Long term:


- Use footing variable name instead of cookiecutter *
- Use shortcuts when listing gh or gl repos *
- Remove all SSH access *
- New prompts and config *
- Only use tokens for auth *
- Login with footing to sync tokens
- Edit structured files
- Validation hooks
- Infra hooks
- Consider eliminating free-form hooks entirely
- Dynamic default values in prompt from template
